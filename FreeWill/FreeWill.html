                    There was a story about a boy, his name was Oedipus. His
                    father, King Liaus of Thebes, heard a prophecy from an Oracle that his boy was fated to
                    kill his father and marry his mother. Terrified, he left his own child to die in the
                    mountains.<br>
                    But shepherds picked him up and he eventually was raised as the prince of another
                    city.<br>
                    When he came of age, Oedipus heard of his prophecy. Terrified, as he did not want to
                    kill his father and marry his mother, he ran away from the city he was raised in, to
                    Thebes.<br>
                    In his adventures, he encountered his birth-father Liaus and in a quarrel, he killed
                    him.<br>
                    Then he freed Thebes from the threat of a Sphinx, earning the hand of the Queen of
                    Thebes, his mother. Unbeknown to him, all attempts to escape fate wove it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inevitably, what was to be, became.

                <p>
                    Fate is the precursor to determinism. The idea that one
                    event leads inevitably to another like a chain of dominos, and no matter what we do,
                    we're just along for the ride.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more we learnt about the world, the more it seemed to follow a
                    cause and effect. Physics tells us that if you know the initial conditions, then you
                    know everything that will follow.<br>
                    This is determinism.<br>
                </p>


                <div class="col-sm-12 med-col">

                </div>

                <p>
                    If the laws of physics describe so accurately the world,
                    allowing us to predict the seasons, the stars, the fundamental makings of the cosmos,
                    how can we ever break free from those laws?<br>
                    Do we simply fall into the chain of events, no differently than a rock tumbling down a
                    hill?<br>
                    But then again, why can't science predict our behaviour? Or the weather?<br>
                    Maybe there's things that science can't explain, and maybe that's
                    where free will lies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe determinism and free will could
                    coexist?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe science got it wrong and the laws don't
                    work.<br>
                    Things aren't as clockwork, and magic can happen.<br>
                    At least sometimes?

                    But as our buildings got bigger, we had to get smarter. We

                    How many sheep we traded to get more sticks and stones, for our buildings.<br>
                    And when to plant crops, and when to feed them to the goats...<br>

                            not recovered. Not only were we not the center of the world, but we weren't
                            particularly special among animals.<br>

                <p>
                    So what is "Free Will"?
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Will" is the choice that is made, and
                    "Free" is that it is not coerced, determined only by
                    "you", the agent.

                    In philosophy, everything has to be well-defined, but we
                    can never agree on the definitions.<br>
                    So while we may disagree, let me show what to disagree on.

                        If "Will" is what results in actions, what
                        has "Will"? If we assign "Will" only to humans, we fall prey to
                        anthropocentrism. Some would assign "Will" to most animals, so maybe as far
                        as dogs, cats.<br>

                        Suppose a person has been raised all their lives to

                        act in some particular way, or at least it makes some of their actions very
                        predictable. Were they coerced? Brainwashed?<br>
                        Maybe I tell a child he absolutely needs to write with his right hand, because the left

                                If I hold a gun to your head, and ask you to dig your own grave, you could say
                                that's coercion... But you could technically refuse. You could exert your
                                ultimate radical freedom and do nothing, preferring death over
                                bending the knee.

                                hypnosis to make you do things.

                        I mean, it's not like something like half of humans experience weird mood swings
                        by no fault of their own due to some silly hormones, that would be ludicrous!

                        The number of ways our brain can be manipulated is
                        outstanding...

                    <p>
                        And if everything is constrained to the laws of physics, then the only thing that
                        we can be free from would be these laws, then we're bound to these laws, we are not
                        that much different than rocks rolling down a rocky hill. We're physical things
                        simply reacting as the laws permit.

                    <p>
                        In other words, if we are not free from the chain of
                        causation, the dominoes from the beginning to the end, if we can't pick whether
                        or not to obey the laws of physics, there's no freedom to be had.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we're not free from causation, we are not free,
                        because it's the only thing to be free from.

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, we seemingly cannot chose to make a
                        decision because that's still a decision in of itself.

                            But physics does not predict predictability.<br>
                            When we discussed knowing the initial conditions we did not discuss what if they were
                            ever so slightly different.<br>
                            This has to do with what is known as Chaos Theory or

                            unpredictable. Something as simple as a

                            A double pendulum remains unpredictable, but remains a
                            thing that has no freedom from the laws of physics and definitely has no
                            will.

                            It doesn't matter if you are two twin brothers, or
                            two pendulums stuck together, it doesn't seem that the variety of observed events
                            has anything to do with dismissing determinism or demonstrating free will.

                <p>
                    It's very tempting to hide away free will behind a
                    quadruple-pendulum, or quintuple or whatever;<br>
                    some system so complex it is in practice unpredictable, and hence we hide the
                    "freedom" in things that are just too difficult to model, but are in
                    principle, still, perfectly predictable.

                <p>
                    Things can be for all practical purposes unpredictable,
                    yet remain perfectly deterministic

            <div class="med-section row">

                <p>
                    An omniscient being, that knows every decision
                    you'll ever make, like a bearded man in the sky or something, would be a strong
                    indication that determinism is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such, since a bunch of people believe in that being, they often
                    conclude that determinism is true, but also generally think that free will is still
                    true. They have their reasons, but I want to say why I think the two are
                    irrelevant.<br>
                    Omniscience does not imply determinism
                </p>
                <p>
                    If history is a particular path on a plane of all
                    possible paths, then omniscience is seeing the plane, not just the path. Seeing the
                    plane, and knowing all possible outcomes.<br>
                    You could then say that if he knows the path, then the path is predetermined. Still, we
                    know all the path going backwards into our own history and it doesn't seem more
                    or less predetermined.<br>
                    To a higher dimensional being, the past and the future could be
                    indistinguishable.<br>
                    Whether or not seeing time as a line, or all possible times as a plane is even possible
                    in theory or how that would be, I don't know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You know the decisions made in the past, that knowledge
                    does not necessarily mean that the past was deterministic.<br>
                    You also can very easily predict the decisions that will be made by your best friend in
                    a given situation, and while that hints to determinism, it doesn't necessarily
                    mean it's deterministic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The point is there's no reason why omniscience (or
                    knowledge) should necessarily imply determinism.

                    In a nutshell, this level of AI is not crazy complicated
                    to understand, the AI tries stuff and learns from what the results are. You expose it
                    to new stuff and it uses what it has learnt to make a modified choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, thinkers in the past didn't have to dwell in
                    this question, but now we do. How do we know if artificial agents can have will, and
                    whether it is free or not?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem here begins in the fact that sufficiently sophisticated
                    AI would be indistinguishable from human behaviour. That might seem like an episode of
                    Black Mirror, but telling someone in 1970's that in 40 years time they'd be
                    capable of accessing piles of information in a tiny computer in their pocket would
                    too.<br>
                    Hell, the wright brothers thought they'd

                    What is experience for a human, it's data to a
                    machine, DNA is code, and stimuli are input.<br>
                    Once we modeled something like or better than a human brain, we have to ask the
                    question whether a machine is capable of will, and whether that will is free.<br>

                <p>
                    If it is indeed possible, then what would make these
                    machines any less special than us?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That they were designed by humans? Arguably, we were
                    designed by nature, in a process of trial and failure we call evolution...<br>
                    That they are machines? Arguably, we are biological machines... <br>
                    That we impose our will on them? Arguably, it needn't be the case that we tell it
                    what to do, and arguably, the will of nature is imposed on us.<br>
                    That it is not free? Arguably, they can use the same physical processes we use, if not
                    more... 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It becomes hard to argue that humans are capable of free will, but
                    not sufficiently sophisticated machines.<br>
                    If there's no critical distinction between the two, then both are either capable
                    or incapable of free will.

                        decisions. Sure, you might not chose how tall you'll be, but you definitely can
                        chose what you do.

                        But at a core, we are free. More or less free depending
                        on say, how drunk we are, or how we were raised, but for the most part, we can create
                        our own chain of events.

                    <p>
                        Sure, if the world was deterministic, we'd have no
                        free will, but since we have free will (as it seems we do) then determinism is
                        false!

                        Simply put, very very tiny things behave
                        probabilistically. There's a thing that's most likely to happen, but it
                        might not. Something else might happen.<br>
                        The best we can do is predict the odds of an event happening.

                        Now, at this point, some people argue ardently one

                        <li>
                            There it is! Our free will. A quantum
                            consciousness capable of transcending the simple laws of physics.

                            Things aren't just probabilistic or random. Science simply does not understand the deeper underlying
                            hidden laws. Things are still deterministic in some higher level.

                        The first one leads us back to Libertarianism, and the

                    <p>
                        Let's talk about the first point,
                        indeterminism.
                    </p>
                    <div class="container-fluid med-container-fluid">

                                Sigh... Here we hit the limits of human understanding (and mine).<br>
                                To start with the first point, (<i>our current mainstream interpretation of</i>) 
                                quantum mechanics remains probabilistic, which means 90% of
                                the time or more it will land exactly where you expect it to land. 
                                So, we can <b style="">at most</b> be
                                expected to be some percentage "free".
                            </p>

                            </p>
                        </div>

                    <p>
                        And that's assuming that quantum physics actually impacts our "consciousness". 
                        We can explain a vast amount of phenomena in the world without invoking the probabilistic quantum nature.
                        <br><br>
                        It's only when we make
                        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/6/13187820/one-nanometer-transistor-berkeley-lab-moores-law">transistors so small</a>
                        that quantum tunneling becomes a problem, or when we make
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">two tiny slits and send individual particles into it</a>.
                        While our brains have lots of small cells, they're not nearly small enough for quantum
                        weirdness to kick in.<br>
                        So even if indeterminism gives us the opportunity to create causal chains, we probably don't.<br>
                        But suppose we do. Suppose 10% of the decisions you make, at random, you instead roll a
                        dice, and based on the outcome, you do something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You make a table with choices, roll a dice, and based on
                        the number, you do the choice in the row the dice rolled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then you say, "Behold! My freedom!"&hellip;<br>
                    </p>
                    <div class="container-fluid med-container-fluid">

                                Then you remember the same happens to tape-worms. 
                                And actually, sub-atomic particles in your coffee.<br>
                                So, while coffee might not be considered an "agent" or have
                                "will", it has the same kind of "freedom" you're invoking
                                to be "free". And the tape-worm has it all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hell, a <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3597793">quantum random number generator</a>
                                does just the trick, I'll lend it to you at the next fork in the road you cross.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        That is to say, you'd have to consider a dice-roll
                        (on some small percent of the decisions you make) to be your free will, assume that
                        percentage is even significant, and assume that there's indeed a dice-roll in the
                        first place. And worms do it too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now back the second point, it simply says determinism is still
                        true, we're just too stupid to get it.<br>
                        We don't yet understand the "hidden causes" behind the
                        dice-roll-looking behaviour.&nbsp;

                    <p>
                        Einstein spent the latter part of his life defying quantum physics... He never came to
                        terms with the fact that reality is inherently random and probabilistic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea that there's something else determining things, and we just don't know it yet is the idea of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory">Hidden Variable Theory</a>.<br>
                        Since it doesn't change of free will discussion, we'll just leave that
                        little nugget for the sake of completeness and as an exercise for the reader.<br>

                        Whether or not physical laws are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory">deterministic</a>, 
                        remains to be seen. 
                        It's probable that as the scientific knowledge gets refined, 
                        we sway from one end to another. Either way, if your idea of "free will" 
                        requires freedom from causation you could end up disappointed, 
                        so I would not count on it.

                    It appears to me, as stated not too subtly in this totally impartial piece, that we
                    like to feel special, but we aren't.<br>
                    Will is not well-defined, but also assigned arbitrarily to some things and not
                    others.<br>
                    Randomness does not constitute freedom, coercion exists in a spectrum, so we
                    can't rely on arbitrary notions of "free from coercion".<br>
                    The Ego is constantly changing, possibly multiple such egos, so the agent is

                        To draw an absolute line anywhere requires some very
                        heavy arguments, particularly because these are all spectrums and the boundaries are
                        more than fuzzy. What is it so special of a free-willing entity that other entities do

                        You can argue that you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox">don't need to identify a clear division</a>,
                        which could be fair,
                        but it could also indicate that you're talking about a useful metaphor, rather than
                        a concrete thing at all.

                        It appears to me that Will is a word to explain a
                        complicated idea, like feelings, but it does not map to physical phenomena
                        directly.

                        Freedom, or liberty has no better luck. Without quantum physics, we
                        can't create new causal chains, so first we have to assume our brain is affected
                        by quantum level noise.<br>
                        And then, that's the same noise we get in
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation">empty space</a>. 
                        It's not a characteristic of the being,
                        just inherent noise in the physical world.

                        In order to show free will, you'd have to be able

                        All of them.

                        The laws of physics aren't rules that constraint

                    <p>
                        So, if we have rules, let's make a game. Let's also
                        pretend that the game is not in our world cause then we get into a free-will-recursion
                        or something...

                        <p>
                            Let's say I shuffle a deck of cards, and then me
                            and my friends draw one card at a time. We look at the card and based on the card, we
                            must follow some rule, like let's say five means drinks for guys, six for chicks,
                            three for me, two for you and whatever.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, if the rules don't permit me to do anything, the cards
                            that will be drawn were determined the moment they were shuffled.<br>
                            That doesn't make it predictable, as there are in fact more ways to
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNS1QvDzCVw">shuffle a deck than there are atoms on Earth</a>, 
                            and someone should tell that to my drunk friend since I keep drawing three.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you peeked at the deck though, then you would know
                            every single card that would be drawn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sure, King's Cups rules require some decisions to
                            be made AFTER, but that needn't be the case... You might drink once per face
                            value of the card for example, and the cards you will draw have all been determined
                            before you start.

                            We don't get to skip our turn, or roll 1 die instead of 2 or whatever,

                            ridiculously high, that you may as well consider it as if it was free, and requires
                            will. Sure, you can't move the pawn like a queen, but you can chose which pawn to
                            move.

                        In some sense, the problem of free will is like the

                        No, you don't have free will, but you have no choice to live as if you did.<br>
                        But there are three big takeaways you should try to get from this:

                        <li>

                            lucky for any of your achievements, whether because you rolled well on the genetic
                            dice, on the country dice, on the nurture dice, on the quantum-decision

                        <li>
                            Don't be too hard on others. You have no
                            idea of the chain of dominoes weighing on the back of that person, forcing them (or
                            pushing them, or coercing them, whatever) to make the decision they made.

                        your weird dislike of Nickelback.

                        You can't chose to not chose, since that's a
                        choice, even if that choice is illusory. You still in charge of your
                        destiny.

                        I embrace the absurdity of acting like I have a
                        choice, because I have no other choice.

                    You're probably either denying what was said
                    in-lieu-of sustaining the belief of your free-will, or going through a mild
                    existential crisis as you think that maybe you have no free-will.<br>
                    Or Possibly, you've already known this and heard it all before and have piles of
                    reason more to agree or disagree with me.

                <p>
                    Either way, I hope this made you think.
